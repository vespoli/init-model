Use this in place of ng-init

This will allow us to initialize a model based on whats in the markup. Angular would have you create a custom 
service to initialize your model. This "feature" is great for SPA, crap for CMS

Solved the issue of Angular dropping an "undefined" empty option in your static select elements with a model

Keywords: ng-init, ng-model
